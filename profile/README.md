This isn't actually me. It's a log.

I'm a staff engineer on the Copilot Agents team at GitHub. I've worked in security products, built parts of [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), the [CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/), and the [CodeQL VS code extension](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/).

I got a PhD in Computer Science a long time ago from [the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/).
